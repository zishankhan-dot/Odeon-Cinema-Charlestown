 ✅ Business Requirements and Functionalities

    🎬 Movie Listings: Home page displays a collection of movies with cards and a Bootstrap carousel.

    👤 User Login/Signup: Users can register and login using email and password - redirect user based on role.

    🛒 Cart System: Logged-in users can add movies to their cart, update quantity, or delete movies.

    🔐 Admin Access: Admin users (verified via email stored in admin.json) can view all user data in /Admin.html where userdetail will be fetched dynamically.

    📦 Order Handling: Cart updates reflect user-specific movie selections with quantities on cart page which can be accesed dynamically in table format with button to update and      delete in /cart.html (path)

    🔄 Dynamic Frontend: Pages use JavaScript to handle interactions like add/remove movies, update cart, fetch cart , fetch user-admin only and so on.
